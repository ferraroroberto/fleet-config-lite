"""Shared helpers for the fleet-config-lite Copilot CLI hooks.

Every hook here follows the same contract as the parent fleet-config repo:

* Reads a single JSON payload from stdin.
* Never blocks anything — these hooks are advisory-only state writers.
* Always exits 0, even on failure, so a broken hook can never disturb the
  Copilot session it observes.

GitHub Copilot CLI's hook payloads are **camelCase** and carry **no event
name field** (verified live against Copilot CLI 1.0.70, 2026-08-01):

* ``userPromptSubmitted`` → ``{"sessionId", "timestamp", "cwd", "prompt"}``
* ``sessionStart``        → ``{..., "source", "initialPrompt"}``
* ``agentStop``           → ``{..., "transcriptPath", "stopReason", "stop_hook_active"}``
* ``sessionEnd``          → ``{..., "reason"}``

``timestamp`` is epoch milliseconds. Because the payload does not name its
own event, the hook-config JSON passes the event name as ``argv[1]`` to the
hook script — see ``hook-config/session-state.template.json``.

``normalize_payload`` converts the camelCase envelope to the snake_case
vocabulary the writers read (``session_id``, ``cwd``, ``transcript_path``),
so a future harness that already speaks snake_case passes through unchanged.
